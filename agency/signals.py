# signals.py
# This file intentionally left minimal - all business logic is handled in inventory/signals.py
# to avoid signal conflicts and ensure proper sequencing of operations.

# If needed, utility functions for debt calculation can be added here,
# but signal handlers should remain in their respective domain modules.
